            <span class="heading">A CLEANER AND SAFER PLACE FOR YOU TO TRAIN</span>
            <p>
                Your safety, and that of our staff and self-employed PTâ€™s, is our top priority.
                In line with government guidelines, we have made a number of changes to ensure that
                Viva Gym is a safe and healthy place for you to workout.
                <br><br>
                When you come back you'll notice Your Gym will look a little different, but
                you'll still get everything you need for a great workout.
            </p>
            <span class="subheading">HERE ARE SOME OF THE CHANGES YOU CAN EXPECT:</span>
            <p>
                <span>KEEPING SOCIALLY DISTANCED</span>
                Viva Gym has made it possible for you to train safely and practice good
                social distancing. Your Gym has been rearranged and clearly marked out for you
                to use safely. The number of members in You Gym will be monitored so its never
                to busy. Thorough and frequent cleaning.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>CLEANING STATION</span>
                Before we open Your Gym, we will do a deep clean with high grade anti-viral
                disinfectant. The team will clean equipment and surfaces throughout the day,
                from dumbbells to treadmills and everything in between, so you can train with
                confidence. We still encourage you to clean your kit before and after use, for
                added peace of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>HAND SANITIZER</span>
                You will find hand sanitizer around the gym so it's easy to regularly clean your
                hands during your visit. Staff will ask that you also sanitize your hands
                before entering the gym to keep yourself and others safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>ACCESS</span>
                Viva Gym removed finger print access.<br>
                Easily tap to access.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>MASK ON</span>
                Following government guidelines, you will have to wear a mask doing your workout, unless you are doing vigorous training. No mask, no entry into your Gym.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>TRAINED STAFF</span>
                All staff at Your Gym have been fully trained on our new cleaning and safety
                measures to ensure these are delivered to the highest standard. You'll also
                get the same happy welcome that you've come to expect at Viva Gym.
